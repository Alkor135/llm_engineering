    "Let's build a useful LLM solution - in a matter of minutes.\n",

    "By the end of this course, you will have built an autonomous Agentic AI solution with 7 agents that collaborate to solve a business problem. All in good time! We will start with something smaller...\n",

    "Our goal is to code a new kind of Web Browser. Give it a URL, and it will respond with a summary. The Reader's Digest of the internet!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, you should have completed the setup for [PC](../SETUP-PC.md) or [Mac](../SETUP-mac.md) and you hopefully launched this jupyter lab from within the project root directory, with your environment activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If you're new to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

    "If you'd prefer to work in VSCode, [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/676f2e19-c228-8012-9911-6ca42f8ed766) are instructions from an AI friend on how to configure it for the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're relatively new to programming -- I've got your back! While it's ideal to have some programming experience for this course, there's only one mandatory prerequisite: plenty of patience. üòÅ I've put together a set of self-study guides that cover Git and GitHub, APIs and endpoints, beginner python and more.\n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",
